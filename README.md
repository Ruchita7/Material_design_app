##Instructions

###Get the source codes

Get the source code of the library and example app, by cloning git repository or downloading archives.

 * If you use **git**, execute the following command in your workspace directory.
 
    `$ git clone https://github.com/Ruchita7/Material_design_app.git `
    
* If you are using Windows, try it on GitBash or Cygwin or something that supports git.
 
###Import the project to Android Studio
 
Once the project is cloned to disk you can import into Android Studio:

 * From the toolbar select **File > Import Project**, or Import Non-Android Studio project from the Welcome Quick Start.

 *  Select the directory that is cloned. If you can't see your cloned directory, click "Refresh" icon and find it.

 *  Android Studio will import the project and build it. This might take minutes to complete. Even when the project window is opened, wait until the Gradle tasks are finished and indexed.
 
 ###Build and install using Gradle

If you just want to install the app to your device, you don't have to import project to Android Studio.

 •  After cloning the project, make sure **ANDROID_HOME** environment variable is set to point to your Android SDK. See [Getting Started with Gradle](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Getting-Started-with-Gradle).

 •  Connect an Android device to your computer or start an Android emulator.

 •  Compile the sample and install it. Run gradlew installDebug. Or if you on a Windows computer, use **gradlew.bat** instead.
